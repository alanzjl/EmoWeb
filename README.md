# EmoWeb_Tutorial
Tutorial to EmoWeb, a web-based sampler for emotion detection of dialogues

## Introduction
EmoWeb is a web-based sampler for emotion detection of dialogues.

EmoWeb is developed by Jialiang Zhao.

## Usage
Currently no GUI is developed for EmoWeb. Users need to login via GateOne, a web SSH terminal. 

###First Step
Open https://overseas.alanzjl.com/emoweb 
        	(! http is forbidden)

###Second Step: Login to server
Leave Host and Port to be blank (just press ```Enter```)

for the ```User``` entry, type in ```emoweb```

for the ```password``` entry, type in ```common```

###Third Step: Login to Emoweb

If you already have an account, just type in your username and password and start sampling.

If you don't have an account, just pick a username (length>5), and if this user doesn't exit, the system will automatically create this user. Follow the instrucitons to create password for it.

###After That:
Please press a number from -1 to 3 for each sentence.

**IMPORTANT: Sentences are grouped as sections. Do not quit this web during sampling whithin one section, or your data won't be recorded.**

Normally, one section contains 100-300 sentences.

## How to use the data generated by EmoWeb
We provide two methods to read and manipulate with your data.

### Via txt
A ```data.txt``` file is auto generated. All information is included in this file.
An example:
```
================================================================================ 
Data for alanzjl from EmoWeb
Here are 538 labelled data in our database
Thanks for your contribution to this web! 
This file is auto-generated. 
Please contact Jialiang Zhao if you have any question 
================================================================================ 

|    count		|	speaker	|	label	|sentence

1 / 538		0	0	有人说，世界上有两颗头的蛇，一前一后互为首尾。
2 / 538		1	2	您确定那不是火车?
3 / 538		0	2	二者杀伤力有可比性吗?
4 / 538		1	0	对比一下就知道了。
5 / 538		0	0	两头蛇的传说源于人们对黑暗的恐惧。
6 / 538		1	2	什么样的恐惧?
7 / 538		0	0	黑暗里有不确定的危险，当你身处其中，你会觉的各个方向都有一双盯着你的眼睛。
8 / 538		1	0	尤其是胆小的人。
......

```



### Via Python Numpy
This method is recommended. A formatted Python Numpy file ```data.npy``` is generated. You can modify our ```get_EmoWeb_data.py``` to gain access to this file. This file contains a huge 4-dimensional matrix.

Before using this file, you need to install ```Python``` and ```numpy```

####If you use Linux
#### for Ubuntu/Debian,
use ```sudo apt-get install python``` to install Python, and use ```sudo apt-get install python-numpy``` to Install Numpy. You can also use ```pip``` to install ```Numpy```.

#### for Archlinux,
use ```sudo pacman -S python``` to install Python, and use ```sudo pacman -S python-numpy``` to Install Numpy. You can also use ```pip``` to install ```Numpy```.

###If you use MacOS
You can easily get ```Python``` and ```Numpy``` via ```HomeBrew```. Type
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
in your Terminal to install HomeBrew. More detailed instructions are listed in https://brew.sh/

Then install ```Python``` and ```Numpy``` using ```HomeBrew```.

###If you use Windows
You can use ```PyCharm```, a Python IDE under Windows (it is also supported in Linux and MacOS). Or just download and install ```Python``` and ```Numpy``` from their official websites.
Personally, I prefer ```WSL: Windows Subsystem for Linux```, which is only supported in ```Windown 10 Pro```.

However, just use the ```.txt``` file if you think the above methods are too complicated.

### Data Stucture
A printer function is pasted here, and you will know how to manipulate with it from the following code.

import numpy as np

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = np.load('data.npy')   # Data file from EmoWeb
    print "-->\tData Size: ", data.shape[0]
    print "-->\tCnt\t|\tSpeaker\t|\tLabel\t|\tSentence"
    for i in xrange(data.shape[0]):
        print "-->\t%d/%d\t|\t"%(i+1, data.shape[0]) + data[i][0] + "\t|\t" + data[i][2] + "\t|\t" + data[i][1]

```

An important thing is, every entry of the data is in ```String``` type. If you want to get the value of a label, use ```int(data[i][2])```
